This aims to develop a management system to help me manage my work and study.I desperately need to search my files ,especially papers quickly and make plan for #TODOs. I also prefer to use interface based on code or command and make the system arrange the styles and architectures automatically. In some way, I think drag blogs will cost my time and interrupt my ideas.
